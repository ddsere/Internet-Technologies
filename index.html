        Text Semantics
        <p>
          Text semantics in HTML refers to the use of meaningful tags that
          describe the purpose or role of the text content, rather than just its
          appearance. Semantic tags like "Strong" help define the structure and
          meaning of the text, making it easier for browsers, search engines,
          and assistive technologies to interpret and present the content
          accurately.

        HTML Lists
        <p>
          HTML lists are used to group related items together in a structured
          way. There are three main types: ordered lists (ol) for numbered
          items, unordered lists (ul) for bulleted items, and description lists
          (dl) for term-definition pairs. Lists help organize content clearly
          and improve readability for users and accessibility tools.

        HTML Hyperlink
        <p>
          HTML hyperlinks are used to connect one web page to another using the
          `a` tag. The `href` attribute defines the destination URL, allowing
          users to navigate to external sites, internal pages, or downloadable
          files. Hyperlinks are a core part of web navigation and help connect
          content across the internet.

        Icons
        <p>
          Icons in HTML are small graphical symbols used to represent actions,
          content, or ideas visually. They enhance user interfaces by making
          navigation and interaction more intuitive.

        HTML Media Content
        <p>
          HTML media content refers to the use of elements that embed audio,
          video, and images into web pages. Common tags include `img` for
          images, `audio` for sound, and `video` for video playback. These
          elements allow multimedia integration, enhancing user experience and
          making content more engaging and interactive.

        Hosting
        <p>
          Hosting in web development refers to the service of storing website
          files on a server and making them accessible on the internet. Web
          hosting providers offer space on their servers where you can upload
          your site's HTML, CSS, media, and other files, allowing users to view
          your website using a browser.

          Form elements in HTML are the building blocks used to create
          interactive forms that collect user input. In the provided code,
          several key form elements are demonstrated:

        HTML Tables
        <p>
          HTML tables are used to display data in a structured format using rows
          and columns. The `table` tag defines the table, while `tr`, `th`, and
          `td` are used to create rows, headers, and data cells. Tables are
          useful for organizing information like schedules, comparisons, and
          reports in a clear, grid-like layout.

        HTML Structural
        <p>
          HTML structural elements define the layout and structure of a web
          page. Common tags include `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`,
          `article`, `aside`, and `footer`. These elements help organize content
          logically, making it easier for developers to manage and for browsers
          and screen readers to understand the page’s structure.

        CSS Intergration
        <p>
          CSS integration refers to the ways CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can be
          applied to HTML to style and format web content. There are three main
          methods: **Inline CSS** (style applied directly within an HTML tag),
          **Internal CSS** (using a `style` tag inside the `head` section), and
          **External CSS** (linking to an external `.css` file using `link`).
          This integration allows control over layout, colors, fonts, spacing,
          and overall design of a webpage.
        </p>

      <br />
      <li>
        CSS Intergration Priority
        <p>
          CSS integration priority refers to the order in which different types
          of CSS are applied when there are conflicting styles. The priority
          follows this order:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Inline CSS - highest priority</li>
          <li>Internal CSS - second highest priority</li>
          <li>External CSS - least priority</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If all three define styles for the same element, the inline CSS will
          override both internal and external styles. Additionally, specificity
          and the order of rules in the stylesheet can also affect which style
          gets applied.

      <br />
      <li>
        CSS text attributes
        <p>
          CSS text style attributes are used to control the appearance of text
          on a webpage. These attributes include `color` to define text color,
          `font-size` to adjust the size of the text, `font-family` to specify
          the typeface, and `font-weight` to control the thickness or boldness
          of text. The `text-align` property is used to align text (such as
          left, center, or right), while `text-decoration` allows adding effects
          like underlines or strikethroughs. Other useful attributes are
          `line-height` for controlling the space between lines,
          `letter-spacing` to modify the spacing between characters, and
          `text-transform` to change the case of the text, such as converting it
          to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalizing the first letters. These
          properties help enhance readability and contribute to the overall
          design of a webpage.

      <li>
        CSS Margins
        <p>
          CSS margins are used to create space outside the borders of an
          element, effectively pushing it away from surrounding elements. You
          can set margins on all four sides—top, right, bottom, and left—using
          properties like `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and
          `margin-left`. Alternatively, the shorthand `margin` property can set
          all sides at once. Margins can be defined using units like pixels
          (`px`), percentages (`%`), or set to `auto` for centering. Proper use
          of margins improves spacing, layout, and overall visual balance in a
          webpage.

      <li>
        CSS padding
        <p>
          CSS padding is the space between an element's content and its border.
          It creates internal spacing, pushing the content inward to provide
          breathing room inside the element. You can apply padding individually
          using `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, and
          `padding-left`, or all at once using the shorthand `padding` property.
          Padding values can be set in units like pixels (`px`), ems (`em`), or
          percentages (`%`). Unlike margins, padding adds to the element’s total
          size and is useful for improving readability and visual spacing within
          elements.

      <li>
        CSS Background
        <p>
          CSS background is used to style the background of an HTML element. It
          allows you to set background color using the `background-color`
          property, add images with `background-image`, control positioning
          using `background-position`, and manage repetition with
          `background-repeat`. You can also use `background-size` to resize the
          image and `background-attachment` to control scrolling behavior. The
          shorthand `background` property lets you combine several of these in
          one line. Background styling enhances the visual design and helps
          highlight sections or elements of a webpage.

        CSS Borders
        <p>
          CSS borders are used to add lines around HTML elements, helping to
          visually separate or highlight them. You can define a border’s width,
          style, and color using the `border` property or control each side
          individually with `border-top`, `border-right`, `border-bottom`, and
          `border-left`. Border styles include `solid`, `dashed`, `dotted`,
          `double`, and more. You can also use `border-radius` to create rounded
          corners. Borders are useful for structuring layouts, drawing attention
          to content, or adding decorative touches to a webpage.

        CSS Boxmodel
        <p>
          The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements
          are structured and rendered on a webpage. Every HTML element is
          considered as a rectangular box made up of four layers: the content
          (like text or images), padding (space around the content), border
          (surrounding the padding), and margin (space outside the border
          separating it from other elements). Understanding the box model is
          essential for precise layout control, spacing, and alignment in web
          design, as it affects the total width and height of elements on a
          page.

        CSS Selectors
        <p>
          CSS selectors are patterns used to target and apply styles to specific
          HTML elements on a web page. There are various types of selectors
          including element selectors (which select all instances of a specific
          tag), class selectors (which select elements with a certain class
          attribute), ID selectors (which target a unique element with a
          specific ID), group selectors (which apply styles to multiple
          selectors at once), descendant selectors (which style elements nested
          within others), and pseudo-class selectors (which target elements in a
          specific state, like when hovered). Selectors help control the look
          and feel of different elements efficiently.
        </p>

      <br />
      <li>
        CSS specificity
        <p>
          CSS specificity determines which CSS rule is applied when multiple
          rules target the same element. It is a system of ranking selectors
          based on their importance. The priority follows this order: <br />
          <br /><span class="para-bold"
            >Inline styles (1000) > ID selectors (0100) > Classes, attributes,
            and pseudo-classes (0010) > Element and pseudo-elements (0001) >
            Universal selectors, combinators, and inherited styles (0000).</span
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          If selectors have the same specificity, the one defined later in the
          CSS is applied. Using !important can override all of these, but it
          should be avoided when possible to maintain clean and manageable code.
